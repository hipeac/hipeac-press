It is a pivotal point of strategic competition globally. As Europe navigates the challenges and opportunities presented by AI, particularly large language models (LLMs), it is imperative to adopt a coherent and proactive strategy that ensures growth, leadership, and the ethical deployment of these technologies. HiPEAC outlines key recommendations for EU&#39;s approach to AI, with a focus on developing AI models aligned with “European” values, which can be executed on edge devices or by a federation of edge devices. The HiPEAC community should develop always more efficient AI accelerators and software but helped by AI-based tools for better productivity in software and hardware developments.</p></blockquote><h1 id="the-very-fast-evolution-of-artificial-intelligence" tabindex="-1">The very fast evolution of artificial intelligence <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-very-fast-evolution-of-artificial-intelligence" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The very fast evolution of artificial intelligence&quot;">​</a></h1><p>by various AI-based tools, including ChatGPT from OpenAI<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>, Marc Duranton</p><p>It is hard to believe that just a few years ago, the reach and accessibility of artificial intelligence were much more limited. Today, AI based on neural networks have made it easier and cheaper to create various content, like texts, pictures and even code. These neural networks come with features like writing, summarizing, text-to-speech, speech-to-text, picture and video creating and editing, transcription and translation, etc. These features are particularly beneficial for creators, enabling them to produce content quickly. AI technologies can convert scripts into speech, enhance text to engage viewers, and even co-create original content. Users can also create avatars from their photos to narrate texts, with the technology ensuring natural lip-syncing and expressive speech. There are hundredth of various tools that emerged in less than a year<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>. Even the domains covered by the HiPEAC community can benefit from the increase of productivity: there are AI tools that helps developing programs (from the specification to debug) and even some of them can help for developing hardware. These two aspects will be covered in separate articles of this HiPEAC Vision.</p><p>The easiness of use of AI-based tools also has drawbacks as it can be used to create fake news, pictures or video quite undisguisable from real ones. They can also be used by hackers to develop new, easy-to-use ways to exploit vulnerabilities (or find how to make bombs, etc). As most AI (using Large Language Models or LLMs) have protections against malevolent use, this leads to hackers trying to find ways to bypass the LLMs&#39; protections, “jailbreaking” them by using more and more sophisticated prompt injection. As the nature of AI based on Neural Networks means that the information is not explicit in an identifiable part of the model, it is very difficult to “erase” sensitive information. Of course, they can be trained with curated datasets without “dangerous” data, but the size of the dataset, and the curation, which is mainly done by humans, make this virtually impossible or too expensive. Fine tuning and other more explicit approaches to sort the input and output are being developed, but they cannot 100% guarantee that the AI are “safe” and that they will not generate output that can be used by malevolent people.</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt=""><em>Figure 1: structure of transformers, from [1]</em></p><p>But these recent AI based on the “transformer” model [1] (the goal of these systems is to “predict” the next “tokens” from a series of input “tokens”) can generate possible outputs, but not “real” ones. They are called “hallucinations” when the outputs of such transformer based LLMs (or other large models) don’t reflect the reality. This is why it is very important to check the veracity of the results of those AI. It is easier in some fields (but not always obvious) such as in code generation: the code can be compiled and executed to check if its syntax is correct and if the results are according to the expectations. It can be also inspected manually, or by the help of other AI that can analyse it.</p><p>AI technology has become one of the fastest-growing fields, particularly since the introduction of GPT, which first appeared in 2018 but didn&#39;t gain significant momentum until November 2022 with the release of its chatbot version, ChatGPT, offering almost human-like communication and quickly becoming the fastest-growing user application in history. Since then, it has transformed the world, for better or worse. Its success can be explained because it was the first computing system that could do a lot of things without explicit programming or choosing a particular specialized application, making its access easy for anybody who can write (in English mainly) and read.</p><p>This era of generative AI also has some impact in the perception of computing systems by people:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Enhanced Capability Perception</strong>: Generative AI showcases the ability of computers to not only process data but also to create new content, be it text, images, or even music. This represents a shift from the traditional view of computers as tools for calculation and data processing. This was a shock for some artists and other people in creative jobs who were thinking that they will be shielded from the impact of computing systems.</p></li><li><p><strong>Blurring the Lines Between Human and Machine</strong>: Generative AI challenges our understanding of creativity, traditionally seen as a uniquely human trait. By producing texts, pictures, and other “creative works,” these systems blur the line between human and machine-generated content, leading to new discussions about the nature of creativity and originality. The fact that the AI understands human languages and writes it correctly was also a significant part of the impact of generative AI, as language is also seen as a human trait. The advanced capabilities of generative AI have led to new discussions about what constitutes intelligence, prompting philosophical and scientific discussions about the nature of intelligence itself (and a redesign of IQ tests and other tests supposed to quantify human capabilities).</p></li><li><p><strong>Results from computers (running generative AI programs) are not always correct</strong>: for the first time, people experienced results of (AI-based) programs that are not reflecting the reality, which are the results of “hallucinations” and no more trustable as humans. Before, computers were supposed to always give “good” results (apart from bugs or programming errors, but they “<em>are executing what they are told</em>” by humans).</p></li><li><p><strong>Interactivity and Personalization</strong>: With AI systems capable of generating personalized content in response to user inputs, the perception of computing systems has evolved from static machines to interactive, responsive entities. This personalization makes technology more accessible and appealing to a broader range of users.</p></li><li><p><strong>Raising Ethical and Societal Questions</strong>: The capabilities of generative AI have sparked conversations about ethics, privacy, authorship, and the potential for misuse. This has led to a perception of computing systems as not just mere tools. As generative AI takes on tasks that were traditionally performed by humans, there is a growing perception of computing systems as potential substitutes or supplements to human labour. This impacts how people view their career paths and the skills they need to develop. People who may not have had the skills or resources to create certain types of content can now do so with the aid of these AI systems, changing the perception of computing from specialist tools to general-purpose enablers of creativity.</p></li></ul><p>The HiPEAC Vision 2023 stated that “<em>today’s ‘large’ models will be optimized and will be able to run on edge devices in the future due to algorithm improvements, optimization tools (pruning and quantization) and optimized hardware.”</em> At that time, we expected that it would be achieved in several years, but it is already realized at the end of 2023 with models with similar performance<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> of ChatGPT 3.5 running on consumer grade computers<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup>, and announcements at the end of 2023 from providers of chipsets for smartphones, indicate that those models will run in (high-end) smartphones in 2024. It is clear that thanks to the new algorithms/structures of AI models that get performance comparable to very large models (of 100s of billions of parameters) with models will only 10s of billions of parameters, thanks also to the improvement of AI accelerators, the technology of generative AI can be run on embedded devices, today smartphones, soon smaller systems. We see also ideas of combining more specialized (or fined-tuned) neural network architectures together to get better performance. This is exemplified by the Mixture of Experts<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup> approach, but it might be extended to having several small AI working closely together (in federation, in swarm of AI, similar to the infrastructure proposed in the next Computing paradigm – NCP – in this HiPEAC Vision 2024). It is important to note that the smaller models which are in competition with the “larger” ones (such as GPT 3.5) are generally fined tuned version of “open parameters” models, i.e. foundation models where the parameters are disclosed in accessible and open repositories such as HuggingFace. Compared to January 2023, nobody would have guessed that these open models would have been competitive and so numerous (HuggingFace offers more than 450 000 models<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup> at the time of writing). This was mainly triggered by Meta which released in February 2023 to researchers the foundation models LLaMA, and the pioneering work of Stanford researchers who showed that these foundation models can be fine-tuned for a rather low cost [2].</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt=""><em>Figure 2: image created by Dall-E 3</em></p><h2 id="key-insights" tabindex="-1">Key insights <a class="header-anchor" href="#key-insights" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Key insights&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li><p>On November 30, 2022, OpenAI released ChatGPT.
