This ‘Rationale’ document is a collection of essays on different topics, authored both by experts in HiPEAC field (principally high-performance, edge and cloud computing systems), and by experts in related areas, such as the technologies that power such systems and the applications that depend on them.</p><p>A companion to the main HiPEAC Vision 2024 recommendations, this volume comprises five sections, each focusing on one of the main areas of the HiPEAC Vision 2024. These are as follows:</p><h3 id="leadership-race-on-the-next-computing-paradigm-ncp" tabindex="-1">Leadership race on the next computing paradigm (NCP) <a class="header-anchor" href="#leadership-race-on-the-next-computing-paradigm-ncp" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Leadership race on the next computing paradigm (NCP)&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Merging aspects of the web, the cloud, cyber-physical systems, the internet of things, digital twins, the metaverse and artificial intelligence into a coherent continuum of computing, the ‘next computing paradigm’ (NCP) is the backbone of the HiPEAC Vision 2024.</p><p>This section sets out what the NCP is and which areas need to be developed to make it a reality, as well as exploring societal implications of some of these computing trends.</p><h3 id="leadership-race-on-artificial-intelligence-ai" tabindex="-1">Leadership race on artificial intelligence (AI) <a class="header-anchor" href="#leadership-race-on-artificial-intelligence-ai" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Leadership race on artificial intelligence (AI)&quot;">​</a></h3><p>One of the key ingredients of the NCP, artificial intelligence (AI) has come to dominate the computing landscape in recent years. The articles in this section – some authored using the large language model ChatGPT – take stock of the state of the art and analyse Europe’s position in the market, drawing out directions in which Europe should focus in future years.</p><p>As well as considering AI as an end in itself, articles in this section also consider the future impact of AI on software development and hardware engineering, respectively.</p><h3 id="leadership-race-on-new-hardware" tabindex="-1">Leadership race on new hardware <a class="header-anchor" href="#leadership-race-on-new-hardware" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Leadership race on new hardware&quot;">​</a></h3><p>New workloads demand new hardware, and the NCP will be a key driver of hardware innovation. With a slowing Moore’s law and the end of Dennard scaling forcing new paths to efficiency gains, with the Chips Act poised to reinvigorate the European semiconductor landscape, and with open standards lowering the barrier to entry, there are plenty of opportunities for hardware development in Europe.</p><p>Articles in the hardware section consider the key components necessary for a quantum ecosystem, show how open hardware offers an opportunity for Europe, and explain why specialization and heterogeneity in hardware are here to stay.</p><h3 id="leadership-race-on-cybersecurity" tabindex="-1">Leadership race on cybersecurity <a class="header-anchor" href="#leadership-race-on-cybersecurity" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Leadership race on cybersecurity&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Representing a shift towards even greater interconnectivity, the NCP throws up even greater cybersecurity and privacy challenges than those faced today. In addition to a greater attack surface, the cyberphysical aspect means that cyberattacks could have tangible, even life-threatening, consequences. Cybersecurity is therefore a requirement for trust, which is essential if the NCP is to be accepted.</p><p>The articles in the cybersecurity section approach the problem from different angles. In addition to setting out cybersecurity and privacy issues in the NCP, they propose potential methods and solutions for greater trust, such as a decentralized internet paradigm, formal security methods for microarchitecture, and a roadmap to secure the microelectronics supply chain, respectively.</p><h3 id="leadership-race-on-sustainability" tabindex="-1">Leadership race on sustainability <a class="header-anchor" href="#leadership-race-on-sustainability" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Leadership race on sustainability&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The final tranche of articles in this volume discuss the topic of sustainability, arguably the greatest challenge of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. With information and communication technology (ICT) representing an ever-increasing proportion of the world’s energy consumption, while also requiring rare minerals and precious resources for their manufacture, sustainability is becoming increasingly urgent in the electronics field.</p><p>The articles in this section discuss what it means to be sustainable, consider the issue of sustainable materials and production, and set out the main concerns for sustainable computer architecture, respectively.</p><p><em>Visit <strong>hipeac.net/vision</strong> for the HiPEAC Vision 2024 recommendations and further context.</em></p><p><em>The HiPEAC Vision 2024 editorial board is indebted to the authors for sharing their knowledge for the enrichment of the community.</em></p>',20),o=[r];function s(c,h,d,l,p,u){return t(),a("div",null,o)}const g=e(n,[["render",s]]);export{f as __pageData,g as default};
